# 6 Lines generate random unsigned numbers
# 26 Lines randomly generate pairs of first six registers and applies SRLV/SRAV/SLLV
# Register values are compared to those from MIPS interpreter
# Next 26 lines are in the form SHIFT $n, $(n-1), $(n-2). This will test for MEM/WB and EX/MEM data hazards INDEPENDENTLY
# Register outputs are checked with MIPS interpreter
# Next 26 lines are in the form SHIFT $n, $n, $register(1-6). This will test for when MEM/WB and EX/MEM data hazards both occur, in which case the value from EX/MEM should be taken
# Register n is checked after all instructions are run
