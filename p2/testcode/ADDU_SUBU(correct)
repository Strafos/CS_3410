# 6 lines generate random 16 bit numbers to assign to registers
# Next 26 lines take ADDU and SUBU and applies on the first 7 assigned registers. Edge cases such as when both registers are the same are accounted for, but no data hazards will occur
# Next 26 lines are in the form ADDU/SUBU $n, $(n-1), $(n-2). This will test for MEM/WB and EX/MEM data hazards INDEPENDENTLY
# Register outputs are checked with MIPS interpreter
# Next 26 lines are in the form ADDU/SUBU $n, $n, $register(1-6). This will test for when MEM/WB and EX/MEM data hazards both occur, in which case the value from EX/MEM should be taken
# Register n is checked after all instructions are run
